In order to map out the frequency with which nutritious and poisonous
plants appear, we wrote a strategy ({\tt
  player1.ExploreMoveGenerator}) that moved around the origin in a
spiral pattern, systematically covering all of the spaces near the
origin. By running a few thousand trials, we produced a plot of the
frequencies, shown in figure~\ref{fig:plant_freq}. It appears that
poisonous plants occur with a constant frequency of about .15, while
nuritious plants have some distribution peaking at the same value at
the origin and decreasing with distance away from the origin.
